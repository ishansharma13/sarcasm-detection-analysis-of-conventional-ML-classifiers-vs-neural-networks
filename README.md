# sarcasm-detection-analysis-of-conventional-ML-classifiers-vs-neural-networks
In this project, we create a sarcasm detection machine learning model based on the news headlines dataset through this
it is concluded that selection of a convinient neural network a model like this can be created which fill function
better if the same is made using conventional machine learning classifiers.
