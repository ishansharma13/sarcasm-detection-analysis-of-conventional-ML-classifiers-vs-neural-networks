# sarcasm-detection-analysis-of-conventional-ML-classifiers-vs-neural-networks
In this project, a sarcasm detection machine learning model based on the news headlines dataset is created.
Through this it is concluded that a model created using a neural network will function better as compared to if it were made using conventional ml classifiers
